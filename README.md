# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Usage
Click the navbar to go between pages. The about page is just a small snippet about me. The contacts page is where you would send an email to me but currently the button does nothing. The portfolio page is just a place holder for now.

## Challenges
This one is a bit bare bones looks wise but it does what it needs to do.

I had a lot of trouble with the footer on this one which I ended up fixing by adjusting the padding on the container.

One thing I learned on this project is I don't like bootstrap. I can work in it if I need to if I get an external css but the bootstrap itself mostly feels limiting. It does do a good job with reactivity though.

I'll be honest I didn't really know about bootstrap components before this. I assumed bootstrap was supposed to be all about the classes more then the prewritten navbar and footer and such.
